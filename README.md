# NixOS-configs
My NixOS configuration files for both my workstation and laptop.


Note: If you want to use my configs, i nixified almost all of them, so you either have to use home-manager on a non-NixOS system for my dotfiles, or you can check out my old config repo that i will keep online, but keep in mind i probably won't be updating those for as long as i keep using NixOS and/or home-manager. sorry :(
