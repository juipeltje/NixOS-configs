# NixOS-configs
My NixOS configuration files.


Note: i have stopped using NixOS due to a lot of annoyances i encountered with it, and i ended up preferring a more "traditional" distro, so these configs are now stored in this repo for safe keeping, but keep in mind that if you want to use them, eventually they will be severely outdated. also, not all of my regular config files are here (they are in my other "configs" repo), so this config is broken out of the box and you can't just use it, it's more for inspirational purposes if anything.
