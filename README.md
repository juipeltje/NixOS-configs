# NixOS-configs
My NixOS-related configuration files.

## Important note!
### I have stopped using NixOS due to preferring to be able to have a bit more control over my base system, like which intit system i want to use for example, so i now switched to a Void Linux + Nix + home manager setup. i decided to keep my configs for full NixOS separated from my main configs repo, so those configs are now stored here. you can use bits and pieces of them if you like, but keep in mind it will probably become outdated eventually. Also, my home manager configs in this repo rely on sourcing my dotfiles, which are not in this repo, so that will definitely be broken ootb, but i hope someone might get some use out of these configs anyway.
